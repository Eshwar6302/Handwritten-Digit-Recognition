# Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project implements a simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model for recognizing handwritten digits using the **MNIST** dataset.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build and train a neural network to recognize digits from 0 to 9 in handwritten images. The model uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.

## Features

- **MLP Architecture**: A neural network with two hidden layers, using ReLU activation for the hidden layers and Sigmoid activation for the output layer.
- **Model Training**: The model is trained using the backpropagation algorithm with gradient descent.
- **Test Accuracy**: Achieved a test accuracy of approximately **12.7%** on the MNIST dataset.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

- **Python 3.x**
- **Numpy**
- **Matplotlib** (for plotting if needed)
- **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** (based on your preferred framework)
